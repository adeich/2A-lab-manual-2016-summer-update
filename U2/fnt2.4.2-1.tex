Refer to \hyperref[act2.4.2]{Activity~\ref*{act2.4.2}}, ``A New Physical situation: Two Masses connected by a Spring'', part A (1).

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Redraw that graph.  Now draw a second curve, on the same graph, for the same two-mass system that has a spring with a spring constant twice as large.  ($r_0$ does not change.).
	
	\item On a new graph, redraw the same graph from part A(1).  Now draw a second curve, on the same graph, for the same two-mass system with the same spring constant, but with an $r_0$ that is twice as big.
	
	\item What physically is the difference between the systems in part a)? part b)?
\end{enumerate}
