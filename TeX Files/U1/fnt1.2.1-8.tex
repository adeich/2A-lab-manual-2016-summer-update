\unit[2.0]{kg} of solid gold (\ce{Au}) at an initial temperature of \unit[1000]{K} is allowed to exchange energy with \unit[1.5]{kg} of {\em liquid} gold at an initial temperature of \unit[1336]{K}. The solid and liquid can only exchange energy with each other. When the two reach thermal equilibrium, will the mixture be entirely solid, or will there be a mixed solid/liquid phase? {\em Explain how you know.}
