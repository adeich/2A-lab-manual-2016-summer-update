\label{fnt2.2.1-6}

Christine's mass-spring system consists of a \unit[250]{g} mass hanging from a spring with a spring constant $k = \unitfrac[0.182]{J}{m^2}$. She pulls the mass down \unit[7.1]{cm} from its equilibrium position and then releases it from rest.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item How much work did Christine do when she pulled the spring down from its equilibrium position? Assume that the mass was at rest before she pulled it down, and before it was released. (Use the \EnergyInteractionModel{}, {\em not} the expression $W = F_\text{avg} \cdot \Delta x$, to determine the work.)

	\item Create a particular model (construct an \EnergyDiagram{}) for each of the following final conditions to predict the speed of the mass after it is released, and when it is:

	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item moving up through the equilibrium position,
		\label{fnt2.2.1-6b1}
		\item moving down through equilibrium, and
		\label{fnt2.2.1-6b2}
		\item \unit[5.0]{cm} below the equilibrium position, moving down.
