\label{fnt6.1.2-1}Three force vectors are added together. One has a magnitude of \unit[9]{N}, the second one a magnitude of \unit[18]{N}, and the third a magnitude of \unit[15]{N}. What can we conclude about the magnitude of the net force vector?  Explain.

\begin{enumerate}[I.]
	\item It must equal \unit[42]{N}.
	
	\item It cannot be \unit[0]{N}.
	
	\item Anything from \unit[-42]{N} to \unit[+42]{N}.
	
	\item It can be anything from \unit[0]{N} to \unit[42]{N}.
	
	\item None of the above can be concluded.
\end{enumerate}
