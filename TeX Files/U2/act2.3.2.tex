\note{Important! }{Assign one only (see activity sheet) to each \SG{}. Have each \SG{} present their response in the Whole Class Discussion. Note that all groups do the last \FNT{}. 
Depending on the number and aptitude of your Small Groups, you may wish to make some adjustment in how you allocate the \FNTs. 
}\begin{overview}

\textbf{Overview:} Before we introduce a new class of physical phenomena, \textbf{\emph{forces}}, we want to make sure you get a bit more practice modeling phenomena using the tools we have accumulated until now, especially the method of graphing energy amounts introduced in the last activities and the carefully crafted model-based, scientific arguments we've been practicing for a while.
	
\end{overview}

\subsection*{We've done a practice activity like this before:}

At home, please work through all the \FNTs{} listed in this activity. In class, each group will work on a portion of these \FNTs{} to come to a consensus before we discuss the scenarios with the whole class.\\

a) Finish any of the prompts 1 - 9 of Activity~\ref{act2.2.3}

Depending on how much you got done in the previous \DLM, Quickly: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Have groups compare their individual responses for prompts 1 – 9 
\item Report out responses to the \WC{} and you make sure everyone gets the main points 
\end{itemize}
(see Instructor Notes on Activity~\ref{act2.2.3}
\\[0.25in]
b) Respond to prompt 10 of the activity
Have each small group put a response to prompt 10 of Activity~\ref{act2.2.3} on the board. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Emphasize that every statement in their explanation must  be justified, which means it is a given of the activity or is a relationship among the constructs in the model.
\item Emphasize that the explanation must be logically complete.
\item Remember, a Model is not an Explanation. Explanations are constructed using a model(s).

They should have a diagram like the one above in part a.

\[mg(0 – 30) + \frac{1}{2}m[v_{f}^{2} – (10)^{2}] = 0\]

Values for part a: $y_{min} = -2$; $y_{max} = 12$; $PE_{min} = -6 $J; $PE_{max} =   36 $J; $E_{total} =   36$ J

Values for part b:		$y_{min} = 0$; $y_{max} = 14$; $PE_{min} = 0$J; $PE_{max} =   42 $J; $E_{total} =   42$ J


\WC{} Discussion:	
\begin{itemize}
\item Their stick figure sketch should make the values of max and min PE obvious. 
\item They should also show that, e.g., PEmax = mgymax. 
\item Have them explain how the graph of PE depends on the choice of location for the origin.  
\end{itemize}

If they apply the relationship: $E_{total} = PE_{grav} + KE$  at the top of the hill they should get a total energy of 19,250 J (assuming $y$ = 0 is at the bottom of the hill). Applying the same relationship at the middle and bottom of the hill will yield different values of total energy, but the same values of speed.

Part a: Make sure the SG clearly labels the max and min PE with numerical values [$PE_{max} = 0.625$ J]. They should understand that the shape must be parabolic, given the functional form of $PE$. 

Part b:	Stay on top of this one. They are not being asked to do any calculations, but to estimate distances representing values of energy at particular values of $x$, and then plot a point for the $KE$. They should label the values on the graph. It should only take them a couple of minutes. 

Part c:	$PE$ for the smaller initial displacement is identical, just over a smaller range of $x$.

\noindent For each of Parts~\eqref{fnt2.3.1-1a} and \eqref{fnt2.3.1-1b} of this \FNT{}, make a simple sketch (not a graph) showing the origin 
(where $y = 0$), the ball's initial position, positions $y_\text{max}$ and $y_\text{min}$, and the floor. Then, for each of your two sketches, show how to find the maximum and minimum values of gravitational potential energy, and the total energy.\\

\noindent Be ready to explain how changing the location of where $y = 0$ will affect $PE_\text{gravity}$.\\

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Draw $PE_\text{spring-mass}$ and $E_\text{total}$ (but not $KE$) on a graph of Energy vs.\ ``Distance ($x$) from equilibrium'' for the case of the mass displaced \unit[5]{cm} from equilibrium and released. Clearly label the maximum and minimum values of $PE_\text{spring-mass}$.
	
	\item Demonstrate how to use point by point plotting to graph the $KE$ by doing the following: For at least two different values of $x$, use energy conservation in the form: ``$KE = E_\text{total} - PE$'' to plot a point representing the $KE$. Label the graph clearly showing $PE$, $E_\text{total}$, and $KE$ at each point. In the Whole Class Discussion you can show how to then fill in the $KE$ by sketching a dashed line connecting the points with a smooth curve.
	
	\item On the same graph, quickly draw $PE_\text{spring-mass}$ and $E_\text{total}$ (but not $KE$) for the case of the mass displaced \unit[2.5]{cm} from equilibrium.
