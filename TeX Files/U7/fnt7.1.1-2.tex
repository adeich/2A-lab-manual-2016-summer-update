A rocket expels gas at a high speed out of its back for a short period of time. We are going to treat the rocket as being far away from any gravitational objects.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Draw a \pchart{} for the rocket expelling gas in space. Take the initial time before expelling gas and the final time after the rocket has finished expelling gas. The rocket has an initial constant speed in the horizontal direction. Put the rocket and the expelled gas on separate rows.
	\item Use your chart to explain why the rocket speed increases. 
	\item Does the rocket have to keep expelling gas to stay at a constant speed? Explain.
\end{enumerate}
