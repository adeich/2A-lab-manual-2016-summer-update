\label{fnt2.4.2-2}

As you know, the electrical force between two positively charged objects is always repulsive and becomes weaker as distance increases, eventually approaching zero as separation goes to infinity.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Relationship 2 of the Particle Model of Matter gives the relation between the force acting between two particles and the potential energy due to this force: the force is equal to the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the particle separation. The force is always in the direction that lowers the potential energy.  Use this relationship to deduce the shape of the graph of $PE$ as a function of $r$ over all possible separations.

	\item Redo Part~\eqref{2.4.2-2a} for two negative charges (Hint: what will be different and what do you know about the forces between the two negative charges?)
	
	\item Redo Part~\eqref{2.4.2-2a} for two unlike charges (Hint: what will be different and what do you know about the forces between these two charges?)
\end{enumerate}
