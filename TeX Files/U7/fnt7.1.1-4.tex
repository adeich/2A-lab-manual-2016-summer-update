%You are riding in a car that crashes into a solid wall.  The car comes to a complete stop without bouncing back.  The car has a mass of \unit[1500]{kg} and has a speed of \unitfrac[30]{m}{s} before the crash (this is about \unitfrac[65]{mi}{hr}).  

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item What is the car's initial momentum?
	\item What is your initial momentum? Recall that the weight of one kilogram is \unit[2.2]{lbs}.
	\item Draw separate \pcharts{} for the car and the person. Treat both as open systems with a net impulse.
	\item What is the change in the momentum of the car?
	\item What is the change in your momentum?
\end{enumerate}
