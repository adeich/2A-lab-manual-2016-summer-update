\subsection{Heavy Ball Swung in a Horizontal Circle -- String Breaks}
\label{act7.2.2}

\note{For Activity~\ref{act7.2.2} (\about\unit[70]{min})}{
\subsection*{Learning Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Get practice identifying momentum and change in momentum in two and three dimensions
\item Get practice identifying impulse from the net force in multiple spatial dimensions
\item Get practice representing impulse, momentum, and change in momentum as vectors using scaled-arrows in momentum charts
\item Get practice defining and analyzing phenomena that occur in more than one dimension using momentum charts to facilitate using the Momentum Conservation Model
\end{itemize}
}

\note{}{If you are behind time you may break up 1 through 5 per table.  

Otherwise don’t let them spend more than 10 minutes on any one problem (The first two follow-ups might take longer).  Have a \WC{} discussion/sharing after each \FNT{}.  To speed things up:   tell students they have 8-10 mins to discuss \& put stuff on boards.  Then call on one or two groups to present.
}
%Discuss and put on the board the following follow-up questions to each FNT. You will have 8-10~minutes per FNT. Each \FNT{} will be followed by a whole class discussion with student presentations.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item On the board, draw a physical picture of the situation. Make sure to include from 10\textdegree{} before the string breaks until after the string breaks.\note{}{Their charts should show that a change of momentum occurs only with the pull of the string, with out it $\vec{p}_{i} = \vec{p}_{f}$.  Be clear that the ball has no previous knowledge of its motion to give it a ``tendency'' to arc.}
	\item On the board, make a \pchart{} for this phenomenon, taking the initial point to be about 10\textdegree{} before the string breaks and the final point to be immediately before the string breaks.
	\item On the board, make a second \pchart{} for this phenomenon, taking the initial point to be immediately after the string breaks and the final point to be after the ball has gone a short distance.
	\item Use your charts to explain the path of the heavy ball, before and after the string breaks.

\subsection{An Asteroid Moving in a Straight Line Receives a Push at Right Angles}
\label{act7.2.2-2}

The diagram below depicts an asteroid, moving with a \textbf{constant velocity}, from point $a$ to point $b$ in space where there is no air resistance. When the asteroid reaches point $b$, an alien (who decides the asteroid is in her way) applies a force for an instant in the direction of the solid arrow. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[inner sep=0pt] (asteroid) at (0,0) {\includegraphics[width=3cm]{asteroid.eps}} node[right=1.5cm] {--- $b$};
		\draw[dashed,thick,-Stealth] (0,-4) -- (0,-1.1);
		\draw (2,-4) node {--- $a$};
		\node[inner sep=0pt] (alien) at (-3.7,0) {\includegraphics[width=1.8cm]{alien.eps}};
		\draw[thick,-Stealth] (-3,0) -- (-1.5,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{FNTenv}
	\input{U7/fnt7.2.1-3}
\end{FNTenv}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{act7.2.2-2a}On the board, make a \pchart{} for this phenomenon taking the initial point to be just before the push and the final point to be just after the push.
\note{\ref{act7.2.2-2a}}{As above but the kick acts as did the string.  Be clear that their vector addition describes the motion of the asteroid.  There is neither latency nor a lasting effect of the kick.  Ask them if an arc implies a continual change of momentum or how you would have to get the ball in problem 1 to curve again after release.}

	\item \label{act7.2.2-2b}On the board, make a second \pchart{} for this phenomenon taking the initial point to be the same point as the final point in \eqref{act7.2.2-2a} and the final point to be after the asteroid has traveled some distance.
	\note{\ref{act7.2.2-2b}}{After the impulse is over, the asteroid’s speed does not change!  Help them see that the speed (and direction) of the puck changes during the impulse (kick) only.  They should be using the chart in 2b.}
		
	\item \label{act7.2.2-2c}Use your \pcharts{} to explain the path of the asteroid.
	\note{\ref{act7.2.2-2c}}{Students will have the tendency to think motion needs a force (this seems reasonable in everyday experience!), so remind them their answer for which does force more closely relate, momentum or change in momentum?  They should be looking at the chart from part~\ref{act7.2.2-2b}.  }
	\item  \label{act7.2.2-2d}Considering your work above in \eqref{act7.2.2-2a} what is the predominant effect of the push?
	\note{ \ref{act7.2.2-2d}}{If the momentum charts have been successful this should be straight forward.  This is similar to the cart bouncing off the bumper end of the track.  The force diagram should include F earth on ball, downward and F ground, perpendicular on ball upward, with greater magnitude than Earth on ball. }
