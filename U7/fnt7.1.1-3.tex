Victoria is standing on a boat, during a perfectly calm day. Initially, both Victoria and the boat are not moving. Then Victoria walks from one end of the boat to the other. Take the initial time to be before she walks and the final time at some point while she is still walking.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Draw a \pchart{} for this situation. Does the boat move, and if so, in which direction?
	\item Compare the speed of the boat with Victoria's speed. Are they the same or different? Why?
\end{enumerate}
