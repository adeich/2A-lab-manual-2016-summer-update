\label{fnt2.3.1-1}

\noindent Christine (from \hyperref[act2.2.1b]{Activity~\ref*{act2.2.1b}}) throws a \unit[300]{g} ball straight up into the air. The ball is exactly \unit[2]{m} above the ground when Christine lets go of it. It reaches a height \unit[12]{m} above the height from which it was released, and then falls straight back down.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item\label{fnt2.3.1-1a} Assume that $y = 0$ at the point of release of the ball. Find the maximum and minimum values of $y$ and $PE_\text{gravity}$.
	
		What is the total energy of the system? Find the maximum and minimum values of $KE$.

	\item\label{fnt2.3.1-1b} Repeat Part~\eqref{fnt2.3.1-1a}, with $y = 0$ at the ground.	
\end{enumerate}
