Consider again the phenomenon of two substances at different temperatures exchanging energy as they come to thermal equilibrium: \emph{Substance A} and \emph{Substance B}, at initially different temperatures, are placed in contact. They are able to exchange energy as heat, and they can only exchange it with each other. Substance A has a greater initial temperature than Substance B. No phase changes occur during this process.

Use the \EnergyInteractionModel{} to create a logical explanation that unequivocally shows that the following statement about the heat exchange described above for Substances A and B is true or that it is false:

	``The energy that is transferred as heat to or from the object with the larger heat capacity must be greater than the energy that is transferred as heat to or from the object with the smaller heat capacity.''
