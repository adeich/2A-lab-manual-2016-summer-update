Consider the following ``problem'' that many beginning physics students struggle with: ``How is it that at a certain instant in time, an object can have zero velocity, but at that same instant, have a non-zero acceleration?''  Figure out how to explain this using the graphs of the motion of the dropped and bouncing basketball, the basic definitions of velocity and acceleration, and Newton's 2nd law.
