%Skipping all these next activities because they're introducing motion graphing. Since we only have a few weeks left, I'm not introducing another new topic. We'll introduce Newton's laws and then finish momentum with the 2D/3D pendulum, coming back to forces to look at that, and then finish 2D momentum at the end of the semester.
