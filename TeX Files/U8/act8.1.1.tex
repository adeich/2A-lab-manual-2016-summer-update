\section{Newton's Laws and Momentum Conservation}
\label{act8.1.1}

\begin{overview}

	\textbf{Overview:} Over the past few weeks, we've dealt a lot with forces, and we know much more about motion in general. We even know that forces cause changes in motion. Sir Isaac Newton, a physicist of the 17th/18th century, formulated three famous laws that powerfully express the relationship between forces and motion. In this next section, we'll discuss these so-called \emph{Newton's Laws}.

\textbf{\textit{Newton's Three Laws of Motion}}

\begin{enumerate}[I.]
	\item Without a net force, there can be no change in the velocity of an object:\footnote{This can be expressed as ``An object in motion remains in motion in a straight line forever unless acted on by an external force;'' and ``An object at rest remains at rest forever unless acted on by an external force.''}
	
	\begin{center}\framebox[1.1\width][c]{If $\sum\vec{F}=0$, then $\Delta\vec{v}=0$.}\end{center}
	
	\item An object will be accelerated if there is a net force acting upon it:
	
	\begin{center}\framebox[1.1\width][c]{$\sum\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$}\end{center}

	\item If object $A$ exerts a force on object $B$, object $B$ \emph{simultaneously} exerts an equal and opposite force on object $A$:\footnote{You may have heard of this as ``For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.''}
	
	\begin{center}\framebox[1.1\width][c]{$\vec{F}_\text{A on B} = -\vec{F}_\text{B on A}$}\end{center}
	
\end{enumerate}

\end{reading}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Come up with a physical scenario that illustrates each of Newton's three laws. Describe each law in both sentence form and with a concise mathematical expression, specific to your example. Be careful and precise with notation in the algebraic expressions.
	
	\item

		\item Refer to the %rocket example of \ref{fnt7.1.1-2}.
		astronaut example from \ref{14C.1}. 
		Recreate a \pchart{} and follow the instructions for the force diagram above. Explain how each of Newton's Laws can be identified in the \pcharts{} and \forcediags{}. Suppose we wanted the rocket to move at a constant speed, is a net force necessary to make this happen?
		
		\item Refer to the boat example of \ref{fnt7.1.1-3}. Recreate a \pchart{} and follow the instructions for the force diagram above. Explain how each of Newton's Laws can be identified in the \pcharts{} and \forcediags{}.

\subsection{Use Newton's Three Laws applied to a system of three objects}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Static} Case: All objects sitting still}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Refer to the picture below of three books sitting on a table that is standing on a floor. Make a separate \forcediag{} for each of the four objects: Books~A, B, and C, and the table. The masses of the books are \unit[0.8]{kg}, \unit[0.2]{kg}, and \unit[0.5]{kg} for Books~A, B, and C, respectively and the mass of the table is \unit[30]{kg}.
	
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}{c}{1}
		% Table
		\draw[double distance = 5pt] (1,0) -- (1,2);
		\draw[double distance = 5pt] (4,0) -- (4,2);
		\draw (0.5,2) rectangle (4.5,2.5) node[midway] {table};
		% Book C
		\draw (1.75,2.5) rectangle (3.5,3.25) node[midway] {C};
		% Book B
		\draw (2,3.25) rectangle (3.25,3.75) node[midway] {B};
		% Book A
		\draw (1.25,3.75) rectangle (3.75,4.5) node[midway] {A};
		% Floor
		\draw (0,0) -- (5,0);
		\foreach \x in {0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5}
    			\draw (\x,0) -- (\x-0.25,-0.25);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	
	\item Identify all 3rd law pairs of forces appearing in your \forcediags{} by circling the two forces and connecting as shown in the diagram on the previous page.
	
	\item Use Newton's 1st and 3rd laws to numerically determine all of the forces acting on the books and the table. If necessary, redraw your \forcediags{} so they are more to scale.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Dynamic} Cases: Objects moving horizontally and vertically}

\begin{enumerate}
	  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
	\item If the books and table together are sliding across the room each at the same constant speed, how would your \forcediags{} change? Show precisely how it would change or explain why it would not.
	
	\item Now imagine the table is sitting in an elevator that begins to accelerate upward with an acceleration equal to $\unitfrac[2]{m}{s^2}$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Make a new \forcediag{} for each book and determine the forces acting on it.
		\item Create a \pchart{} for at least two of the objects.
		\item Do any of the objects experience a net force? If so, give the magnitude and direction of each.
		\item Is it correct to say a force always equals $m\vec{a}$~?
		\item Is it correct to say that, whenever the net force is zero, the velocity must also be zero?
	\end{enumerate}
