\label{fnt8.2.1-3}

Underneath the appropriate column of graphs from \ref{fnt8.2.1-2}, write an equation that solves for the variable in question (see below).  Write which model you used: \FModel{}, \EnergyInteractionModel{}, the \pConsModel{}, %the \LConsModel{}, 
etc... If you introduce any new variables, clearly indicate what they mean.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item The velocity of a dropped object just before it hits the floor. 
	\item The time it takes the dropped object in (a) to reach the floor after being dropped.
	\item The change in velocity for a spacecraft firing its rockets for a certain length of time.
	\item The speed of the race car after the first 10~seconds.
\end{enumerate}
