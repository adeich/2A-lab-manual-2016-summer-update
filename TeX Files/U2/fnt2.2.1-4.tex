In \hyperref[act2.2.1b]{Activity~\ref*{act2.2.1b}} we assumed that $y = 0$ at the level of the floor. If, instead, we assume that $y = 0$ where Christine releases the ball -- still 1.5~meters above the floor -- will this change the maximum height above the floor attained by the ball? Use the \EnergyInteractionModel{} to answer this question.
