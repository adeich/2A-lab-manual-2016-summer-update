\label{fnt8.4.2-5}

Draw three independent pictures of a mass-spring system undergoing an oscillation at t = 0 with a phase constant, \phi, that equals i) \pi/4 rad, ii) -\pi/4 rad, and iii) 3\pi/4 rad.  For each case label the amplitude (each has amplitude A) and place a velocity vector on the mass to indicate its direction of motion.
