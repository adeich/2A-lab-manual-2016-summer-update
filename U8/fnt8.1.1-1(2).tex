\textbf{Cart and Horse Paradox:} If a horse pulls on a cart, and the cart pulls back on the horse with an equal magnitude force, how can either possibly begin to move?

Use what you have learned about force to \textbf{give a complete explanation of this paradox}. For a complete explanation, make complete \forcediags{} for 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item the horse, 
	\item the cart, and 
	\item the whole system (horse \& cart).
\end{enumerate}
