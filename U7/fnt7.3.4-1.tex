\label{fnt7.3.4-1}

In this DL you considered two issues: 
i) 	What forces are necessary to support a beam (against earth's gravity or whatever else is trying to move it)? 
ii) 	Are those forces available in a specific beam?
 In order to discuss these, you talked about extended force diagrams and torque AND you talked about chemical bond energies and strengths using an appropriate potential energy function.   Now check your understanding of these DL activities.  What diagrams and ideas do you use to help you decide what forces are necessary to support a beam?  What diagrams and ideas do you use to decide what forces are available to support a beam?  Be prepared to explain each of your answers.
