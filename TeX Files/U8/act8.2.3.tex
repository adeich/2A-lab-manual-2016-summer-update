\section[\motiongraphs{} and Newton's 2nd Law]{Making Sense of Motion through Graphs And Newton's 2nd Law}
\label{act8.2.3}

\begin{overview}

\textbf{Overview:} We continue our exploration of \motiongraphs{}, especially in the context of Newton's 2nd Law.

Discuss your group's response to the following prompts and then put your responses up on the board.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Describe in words the motion of the object whose velocity is shown in the graph. Practice walking this graph for the whole class presentation.
	\item Explain exactly how you can determine the acceleration from a graph of velocity vs.\ time.
	\item Construct an acceleration graph from the velocity graph shown in this FNT.
	\item Describe in words how the net force on this object changes from one lettered point to the next.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U8/fnt8.2.1-5}
\end{fnt}

Discuss how you can be sure that the values of the acceleration you determined from the velocity graph in regions (a) and (c) are the correct values according to Newton's 2nd law. Show this ``check'' on the board. Note: you do not have to put the graph on the board.

\WCD

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U8/fnt8.2.1-6}
\end{fnt}

Discuss your group's responses to all parts of this FNT and respond to the following prompts.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Put your responses to part (a) on the board.
	\item Put only the \textbf{different} \forcediags{} on the board for part (c) and note above each diagram which points, [1] through [6], it applies to. Make sure everyone in your group understands part (d) and is prepared to share with the class.
	\item Make sure everyone in your group understands part (e) and is prepared to share with the class.
\end{enumerate}

\WCD

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U8/fnt8.2.1-7}
\end{fnt}

Discuss this FNT in your group and put a \textbf{concise} explanation on the board.

\WCD

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U8/fnt8.1.1-1}
\end{fnt}

Discuss this FNT in your group, put the three \forcediags{} on the board, and make sure everyone in your group understands these and is prepared to share with the class.
