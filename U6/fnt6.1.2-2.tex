Alice, Bob and Chuck are three friends standing around, talking. We know that Alice is standing \unit[9]{m} away from Bob, and that Bob is standing \unit[3]{m} away from Chuck. Let $\Delta \vec{R}_\text{AB}$ be the vector that starts at Alice and ends at Bob, and $\Delta \vec{R}_\text{BC}$ be the vector that starts at Bob and ends at Chuck.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Write an equation to find the displacement between Alice and Chuck.
	
	\item What is the furthest distance Chuck can be from Alice, given the information in the question? What is the closest they can be?
	
	\item Draw a picture where Chuck is neither as close as he can be or as far as he can be from Alice. Draw and label the vectors $\Delta \vec{R}_\text{AB}$ and $\Delta \vec{R}_\text{BC}$. 
\end{enumerate}
