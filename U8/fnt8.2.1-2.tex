For the each of the following scenarios make a position vs.\ time graph.  Directly below it draw a velocity vs.\ time graph, and beneath that draw acceleration vs.\ time. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item A dropped object as it is falling (before it hits the floor). 
	\item A rocket firing its engines for a certain length of time descending on Mars.
	\item A racecar during the first 10~seconds after it starts from a stop.
