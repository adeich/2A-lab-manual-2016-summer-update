Two asteroids collide head-on and stick together. Before the collision, asteroid A (mass 1,\unit[000]{kg}) moved at \unitfrac[100]{m}{s}, and asteroid B (mass 2,\unit[000]{kg}) moved at \unitfrac[80]{m}{s} in the opposite direction. Use momentum conservation (make a complete \pchart{}) to find the velocity of the asteroids after the collision.
