\label{fnt2.1.1-2}

A person pulls a bucket of water up from a well using a rope. Assume that the initial and final speeds of the bucket are zero ($v_i=v_f=0$), and that the person lifted the bucket a vertical distance $h$. By looking at energy changes in the bucket-Earth physical system, we can make sense of the force the person must exert to pull the bucket up and determine the amount of work the person does.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Is the system open or closed? What energy systems undergo a change during this process? Construct an \EnergyDiagram{} and include the algebraic expression of energy conservation (in terms of $\Delta E$'s and, if open, any heat or work).
	
	\item Substitute the algebraic expression we use for the change in gravitational potential energy and solve algebraically for the work done by the person on the rope/bucket.
	
	\item Use the definition of work in terms of force and distance (refer to the \EnergyInteractionModel{} Summary) to find the average force exerted by the person on the rope and bucket while they are lifting it up.
\end{enumerate}
