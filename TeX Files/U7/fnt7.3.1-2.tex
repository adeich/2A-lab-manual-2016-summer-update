NOTE: Use the figure of the disk for \FNTs{} 7.3.1-2, 7.3.1-3, 7.3.1-4

7.3.1-2) Circle all of the forces shown acting on a disk of radius r (shown to right) which exert a non-zero torque about point .  Cross out all forces which exert a zero torque about point .  (This is a top view of the disk, as seen from above.)  If you are having trouble, draw these on a piece of paper and holding it at the pivot point, actually apply the force by pulling and see what happens.  For each of forces that exert a non-zero torque, make a drawing showing the moment-arm, r, the force, F, and the tangential component of the force, Ftangential.
