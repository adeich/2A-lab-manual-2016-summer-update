\label{fnt7.2.1-8}

Determine the decrease in total kinetic energy $\Delta KE_\text{total}$ of the two asteroids in \ref{fnt7.1.1-7} and \ref{fnt7.2.1-7} when they collide.  If the average specific heat of the material composing the asteroids is assumed to be that of ice (\unitfrac[2.05]{kJ}{kg$\cdot$\textdegree{}C}), by how much does the temperature of the asteroids rise as a result of the collision in each case?
