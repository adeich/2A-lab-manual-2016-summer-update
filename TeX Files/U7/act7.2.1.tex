\section[2D- and 3D-Momentum and Change in Momentum]{Momentum and Change in Momentum in Two and Three Dimensions}

\begin{overview}
	\textbf{Overview:} So far, we have only concerned ourselves with momentum in one dimension -- which means we've only looked at movement in the ``forward/backward'' directions. However, as you know, we can also move left and right, as well as up and down. In order to consider most real-life phenomena, we have to expand our ideas about momentum to those additional dimensions.
\end{overview}

\subsection{Impulse in Two Dimensions}

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U7/fnt7.2.1-1}
\end{fnt}

\noindent Compare with your group your responses to \ref{fnt7.2.1-1}. Come to a consensus and put your response on the board.

\subsection{A Mass Swinging in a Horizontal Circle}
\label{MassCircle}

\textbf{Phenomenon:} You are going to observe, talk about, and analyze a three dimensional problem. This will give you practice working with vectors and the concept of impulse in more than one dimension and practice determining the net force.

\end{center}

\noindent Hold the ball and swing it so it revolves in a horizontal circle as in \hyperref[act6.1.3]{Activity~\ref*{act6.1.3}}. Focus on a small section of the arc of the circle. Put your responses to the following parts on the board and be prepared to discuss them with the whole class.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If we treat the moving mass (just the ball) as our physical system, is there a net impulse on this physical system? How do you know? (Hint: Is the momentum changing?)
	
	\item What must be the direction of the net impulse acting on the ball? How do you know this from the motion? Explicitly show the vectors $\vec{v}_i$, $\vec{v}_f$, and $\Delta \vec{v}$ on a diagram, drawn from above (looking down on the motion).
	
	\item In which direction must the net force $\Sigma \vec{F}$ be? How do you know this from the motion?

	 Analyze the forces acting on the revolving ball. What objects exert forces on the ball? Remember, these could be contact forces or long-range forces. Now think about a side view of the revolving ball (see figure at right). Use what you know about the directions of these forces and the direction of $\Sigma \vec{F}$ to draw a force diagram for the ball in this side view. Be sure to label all forces with two subscripts and make their lengths appropriately scaled with respect to each other. Show the net force separately with a double arrow.

	\item Write a few sentences explaining why the ball revolves in a horizontal circle in terms of momentum, impulse and net force.
	
	\item Still treating our physical system as the moving ball, is mechanical energy conserved -- that is, does the mechanical energy of the system remain constant? How do you know? You should answer this in terms of energy systems changing or not changing, as well as whether energy is transferred as work.
	
	\item Is the net force more closely related to $\vec{v}_i$, $\vec{v}_f$, or $\Delta \vec{v}$?
\end{enumerate}
