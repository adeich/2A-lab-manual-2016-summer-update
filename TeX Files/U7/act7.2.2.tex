\subsection{Heavy Ball Swung in a Horizontal Circle -- String Breaks}
\label{act7.2.2}

%Discuss and put on the board the following follow-up questions to each FNT. You will have 8-10~minutes per FNT. Each FNT will be followed by a WC discussion with student presentations.
\label{act7.2.2-1}
\begin{fnt}
	\input{U7/fnt7.2.1-2}
\end{fnt}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item On the board, draw a physical picture of the situation. Make sure to include from 10\textdegree{} before the string breaks until after the string breaks.
	\item On the board, make a \pchart{} for this phenomenon, taking the initial point to be about 10\textdegree{} before the string breaks and the final point to be immediately before the string breaks.
	\item On the board, make a second \pchart{} for this phenomenon, taking the initial point to be immediately after the string breaks and the final point to be after the ball has gone a short distance.
	\item Use your charts to explain the path of the heavy ball, before and after the string breaks.

\subsection{An Asteroid Moving in a Straight Line Receives a Push at Right Angles}
\label{act7.2.2-2}

The diagram below depicts an asteroid, moving with a \textbf{constant velocity}, from point $a$ to point $b$ in space where there is no air resistance. When the asteroid reaches point $b$, an alien (who decides the asteroid is in her way) applies a force for an instant in the direction of the solid arrow. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node[inner sep=0pt] (asteroid) at (0,0) {\includegraphics[width=3cm]{asteroid.eps}} node[right=1.5cm] {--- $b$};
		\draw[dashed,thick,-Stealth] (0,-4) -- (0,-1.1);
		\draw (2,-4) node {--- $a$};
		\node[inner sep=0pt] (alien) at (-3.7,0) {\includegraphics[width=1.8cm]{alien.eps}};
		\draw[thick,-Stealth] (-3,0) -- (-1.5,0);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U7/fnt7.2.1-3}
\end{fnt}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item On the board, make a \pchart{} for this phenomenon taking the initial point to be just before the push and the final point to be just after the push.
		\label{act7.2.2-2a}
	\item On the board, make a second \pchart{} for this phenomenon taking the initial point to be the same point as the final point in \eqref{act7.2.2-2a} and the final point to be after the asteroid has traveled some distance.
		\label{act7.2.2-2b}
	\item Use your \pcharts{} to explain the path of the asteroid.
	\item Considering your work above in \eqref{act7.2.2-2a} what is the predominant effect of the push?
