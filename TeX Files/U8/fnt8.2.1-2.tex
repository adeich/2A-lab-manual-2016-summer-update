For each of the following scenarios make a position vs.\ time graph. Directly below it, draw a velocity vs.\ time graph, and underneath that draw acceleration vs.\ time. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item A dropped object while it is falling (before it hits the floor). 
	\item A rocket firing its engines for a certain length of time descending on Mars.
	\item A race car during the first 10~seconds after it starts from a stop.
\end{enumerate}
