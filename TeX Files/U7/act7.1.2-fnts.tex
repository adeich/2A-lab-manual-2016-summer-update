\section{Check for understanding: 1-D Momentum}
\label{14C.1}

\begin{overview}
	\textbf{Overview:} In this section, we'll practice what we've learned so far about momentum, change in momentum, and momentum conservation.	
\end{overview}

\subsection{Collisions and Other Interactions between Objects}

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U7/fnt7.1.1-1}
\end{fnt}

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U7/fnt7.1.1-2}
\end{fnt}

\begin{fnt}
	\input{U7/fnt7.1.1-3}
\end{fnt}

%\subsection*{In Your Small Group}
Compare your responses to \ref{fnt7.1.1-1}, \ref{fnt7.1.1-2}, and \ref{fnt7.1.1-3} with the other members of your small group. Come to a consensus on the appropriate \pcharts{} and answers, and put these on your board.

\textbf{Added problem:} Draw an appropriately scaled force diagram (for each object) that shows all the forces acting during the interaction (when the impulse occurs). Do this for each FNT.

\subsection{More Collisions of Two Carts}

\noindent Your instructor will assign each group a situation from 1--3 below and one from 4--5. Use the \pConsModel{} to analyze each of the collisions between two carts in the Situations~1--3 below. You may treat the system made up of the two carts as a closed physical system because there is no net external impulse imparted on the system during the collision.\\

\noindent\textbf{Situations:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use two carts of equal mass, physically arranged so the carts will bounce off one another. Start with \textbf{\em one cart stationary}.
	\item Use two carts of equal mass, physically arranged so the collision ends with the \textbf{\em carts locked (stuck together)}.
	\item Use two carts of equal mass initially \textbf{\em moving toward each other} with equal speed and \textbf{\em ending with the carts locked (stuck together)}.
	\item Place two carts of \textbf{\em unequal mass} on the track, turned so the collision \textbf{\em ends with the carts locked (stuck together)}. Start with one cart stationary, and have the other move to collide with it. Make the stationary cart have more mass. Repeat, switching carts.
	\item Place two carts of \textbf{\em unequal mass} on the track, turned so the collision \textbf{\em ends with the carts locked (stuck together)}. Start with both carts \textbf{\em moving toward each other} with the same speed.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{For each Situation:}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Draw and fill in a \pchart{} to help you describe momentum conservation in this closed physical system.
	\item For each line of the \pchart{}, write an algebraic vector equation, with appropriate subscripts on the symbols, to express what that line tells you about the collision.
	\item Draw a force diagram for each cart that shows the forces \emph{during} the collision.
	\item Describe in words what physically happened and then how conservation of momentum applies to each cart and to the system as a whole. Put your equation and word statement on the board.
	\item Compare the total kinetic energy before the collision to the total kinetic energy after the collision.% Classify each case as elastic or inelastic.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Observe what is similar and what is different in your \pcharts{}. What patterns can you observe? Discuss in your group any rules you come up with for the patterns.
