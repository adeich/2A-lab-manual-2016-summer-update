Use the \EnergyInteractionModel{} to explain whether the following statement is true or false.

\todo[inline]{Seems like the \textdegree C unit was not converted to using the \texttt{\textbackslash unit} command. I've changed this below, but it should be globally changed somehow if it's not changed in general...

\todo[inline]{I think the spacing in the italics didn't play well with the \textdegree C unit. It shouldn't need fixing anywhere else unless there are other instances of \textdegree C in italics. Using the \texttt{\textbackslash unit} command puts too much space between the number and the unit when we're doing degrees, in my opinion.

-EH}
\todo[inline]{Alright, I changed it from being in italics to being in quotes. Looks better that way. I do like the spacing between the number and the degree sign... Could you add this to the python script? I looked at it but can't really make sense of it, so I'd rather not mess with it...
