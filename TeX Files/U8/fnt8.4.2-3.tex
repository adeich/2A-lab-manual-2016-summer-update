Do the following: 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]	
	\item Using your knowledge of a mass-spring% developed in 7A
	, relate energy to amplitude in variable form.  What is the object's maximum speed in variable form?
	
	\item For a mass-spring system of mass $m$ and spring constant $k$, which alteration will achieve a greater maximum speed, compressing a mass of $2m$ to $x_{max} = A$ or compressing a mass $4m$ to $A = 2x_{max}$?
\end{enumerate}
