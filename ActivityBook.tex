%\todo[inline]{FNT 2.2.3-1 (9?) mis marked in ACT 2.3.2}

%\todo[inline]{Hi Peter,
%
%I just checked, and 2.2.3-9 should be 2.2.3-1. So yes, it is a typo. However, since this is basically in regard to atwood machine, and we inserted the extra lab, it may not be necessary to review in class anyway if you've already covered it.

%\todo[inline]{Hi Cassandra,
%
%Activity 2.3.2 refers at the end to FNT 2.2.3-9 which I could not find in my hard copies or in any of the assignments posted don line.  Is that a typo?  Or am I missing something?

\todo[inline]{Hi Annie,
I like your suggestion better, I think. I was trying to split up 2.3.1 and 2.2.3 because I think they are both very challenging and because the students haven't had a chance to think about them at home, putting them both together would be a particularly taxing DLM. (I realize they were together in the Davis model, but we never completed 2.2.3 in class, they always had to complete it for homework, and I was trying to avoid that.)

That said, I like that your model moves the catch-up to the beginning and splits up the homework more nicely. 

As long as you don't think the issue I've raised is a problem, let's go with what you suggested. As lead TA I give you the power to make the choice. :)

Let's make a note of this for next semester's Activity Book. :)

\todo[inline]{Here is what you proposed with the FNTs added so we can see them:

DLM 7a:
Act 2.2.2
Act 2.3.1
(if time catch up with what you skipped in previous lab)
Regular FNTs assigned EXCEPT writing up 2.2.3 neatly.
FNTs: 2.3.1-1; 2.3.1-2; 2.2.1-7; 2.2.1-8; 2.3.1-3; 


DLM 7b:
Catch up with anything you are behind on THEN
Act 2.2.3
If you have any extra time, you can solve previous quiz, or review tricky concepts.
FNTs are to write up the solution to Act 2.2.3
FNTs: 2.2.3-1


I propose the following:
DLM7A
Catch-up 
ACT 2.2.2
FNTs: 2.2.1-7; 2.2.1-8; (according to current schedule we go over these in DLM8)

DLM7B
Act 2.3.1
Act 2.2.3
FNTs: 2.3.1-1; 2.3.1-2; 2.3.1-3 (according to current schedule we go over these in DLM8)

We still have the minor issue of not going over HW from 7A until DLM8 as we did in your proposal. I think this solution is better b/c I'm worried that ACT 2.2.2 will take a long time (the Instructor notes don't have an estimate for this one) and we will end up rushing through ACT 2.2.3 (which is a difficult activity). In my proposed schedule, we do Act 2.2.2 (long) and Catch-up (shorter), and then we split the time for both Act 2.3.1 and 2.2.3 which gives them 70min for each activity. Also, the assigned HW is a little more balanced.

What do you think?

\todo[inline]{Hi Annie,
For DLM 7, I am going to suggest that we cut 2.2.3 (atwood machine) and make a DLM 7b.

Here is what I propose:

DLM 7a:
Act 2.2.2
Act 2.3.1
(if time catch up with what you skipped in previous lab)
Regular FNTs assigned EXCEPT writing up 2.2.3 neatly.


DLM 7b:
Catch up with anything you are behind on THEN
Act 2.2.3
If you have any extra time, you can solve previous quiz, or review tricky concepts.
FNTs are to write up the solution to Act 2.2.3


Then DLM 8 picks up with FNTs from DLM 7a.
(we will likely also cut 2.4.2 from that set to keep the slower pace.. and also I don't think that activity is relevant.)


What do you think?

\todo[inline]{Hey CP,

Here is what we discussed:
We broke up ACT 7.2.3 so it no longer exists

DLM12A
Second part of ACT 7.1.2
ACT 7.1.3B
FNTs: 7.2.1-1; 7.1.1-4;7.1.1-5; 7.1.1-6; 7.1.1-7

DLM12B
ACT 7.1.3A \& go over FNT 7.1.1-7
ACT 7.2.1
Egg Throw
FNTs: 7.2.1-2; 7.2.1-3; 7.2.1-4; 7.2.1-5; 7.2.1-6; 7.2.1-7; 7.2.1-8; 

The rest is tentative:

DLM 12C
ACT 7.2.2 \& go over 7.2.1-7; 7.2.1-8; 
ACT 7.3.1
FNTs: 7.3.1-1; 7.3.1-2; 7.3.1-3; 7.3.1-4; 7.3.1-5; 7.2.1-9; 7.2.1-10; 7.2.1-11

I've also attached the pic.

\todo[inline]{DLM13B:
Act 7.3.2 (Going over FNTs 7.3.1-1;7.3.1-2;7.3.1-3;7.3.1-4;)
Finish Act 7.3.1
Act 7.3.3 (beam Act - skip bond stuff)
FNTs due DLM14A (7.3.2-1(arm problem);7.3.4-1 (if complete beam Activity))

We need more angular momentum problems where students use the chart.}


\todo[inline]{vectors in picture on FNT 7.2.1-3}

\todo[inline]{Hi all,
If you were in our meeting yesterday, you'll remember that we decided that the students needed to be able to take time to make sense of the angular momentum ideas by drawing on their linear momentum ideas before doing activity 7.3.1.

Therefore, we created a mini activity to do right before 7.3.1. It is attached. Please let me know if you have any questions about what to do in discussion lab. 

Just to sum up, you will be doing:

Activity 7.2.3B (covers FNTs 7.2.1-9 through 7.2.1-11)
Pre7.3.1 activity (attached.... but nothing to hand out to students)
first half of 7.3.1.}

\todo[inline]{Hey CP,

Here's what we decided on yesterday:

DLM12C:
ACT 7.2.2 
      Goes over FNTs: 7.2.1-2;7.2.1-3;7.2.1-4;7.2.1-5;7.2.1-6;
First half of ACT 7.2.3 
       Goes over FNTs: 7.2.1-7;7.2.1-8;
Egg Throw Discussion
FNTs due DLM13A: 7.2.1-9;7.2.1-10;7.2.1-11;

DLM13A
Second half ACT 7.2.3
         Goes over FNTs: 7.2.1-9;7.2.1-10;7.2.1-11;
ACT 7.3.1
FNTs due DLM13B: 7.3.1-1;7.3.1-2;7.3.1-3;7.3.1-4;7.3.1-5;

\todo[inline]{Hi all,

I'd like to request an entry in the activity book for next semester: I think that calling the perpendicular component of the torque ``tangential'' seems highly confusing to me because it's not necessarily tangential to the surface of the object that the torque is acting on. For example, in FNT 7.3.1-2, we have a circle with pivot-point ``theta.'' While F3 and F5 in this drawing have ``tangential'' components that are both tangential to the ``arc of motion'' (for lack of a better termâ€¦) and to the circle that's being rotated, the tangential components of all the other forces are not tangential to the circle.

I think if we would call the components ``perpendicular'' and ``parallel'' to the moment arm, we would make things less confusing\ldots

Also, I think we should replace all bolded letters that denote vectors in all materials with ``arrowed" letters. My students still have issues recognizing bold letters as vectors, even though we talked about this numerous times. I think it would be best if we could keep the notation in the materials as close as possible to the notation they can use themselves (they can't bold anything on whiteboards or in homework assignments).

Thanks,
Benedikt}
