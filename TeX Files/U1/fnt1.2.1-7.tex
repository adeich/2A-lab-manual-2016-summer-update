\label{fnt1.2.1-7}

The \unit[2.2]{kg} block of ice from the \ref{fnt1.2.1-6} is eventually removed from the liquid \ce{N2} (after reaching thermal equilibrium with the liquid \ce{N2}) and placed in a {\em very large} amount of liquid \ce{H2O} at \unit[0]{\textdegree C}, where it comes to thermal equilibrium with the liquid \ce{H2O}. Create a particular model of this process and use it to determine the final mass of the ice.
