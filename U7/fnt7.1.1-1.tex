\label{fnt7.1.1-1}

You're playing with two of the carts (each with mass $m$) that you used in \hyperref[act7.1.1c]{Activity~\ref*{act7.1.1c}}. Initially, these two carts are moving toward each other with the same initial speed $v_i$ along the track. The carts collide and the result is one of these final states:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Assume that the carts hit each other and stop so that the final state of the system has both carts just sitting still (not moving). Draw a \pchart{} for this situation. Make a separate row for each cart.% Refer to \pConsModel{} 
	\item Assume that the carts bounce off each other so that the final state of the system has each cart moving opposite to its initial motion but with the same speed. Draw a \pchart{} for this situation.
	\label{fnt7.1.1-1b}
	\item As in \eqref{fnt7.1.1-1b}, assume that the carts bounce off each other but now assume that the final speeds are smaller than the initial speeds, equal and in opposite directions. Draw a \pchart{}.
	\item For each case above, does the total momentum of the system that contains the two carts change? How do the \pcharts{} help you answer this question?
	\item Is the total kinetic energy constant for all three cases? How do you know?
\end{enumerate}
