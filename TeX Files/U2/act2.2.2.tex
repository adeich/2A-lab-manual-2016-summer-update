\section[More Modeling with Mechanical Energy]{More Modeling of Scenarios involving Mechanical Energy Systems}
\label{act2.2.2}

\begin{overview}
	
	\textbf{Overview:} In this activity, we will explore additional scenarios that are related to phenomena we've already discussed. Here, we add some variations to the scenarios and answer some different questions we haven't asked yet.
	
\end{overview}

\noindent\textbf{Note:} Remember Christine throwing a ball in the air in \hyperref[act2.2.1b]{Activity~\ref*{act2.2.1b}} (page\pageref*{act2.2.1b} )?

Numerical answer: Maximum distance above floor = 6.5 m.\\[0.25in]
Follow up question: Use your judgment about how much help they need to get the main idea, i.e., the Energy Interaction Model is all about changes in energy ($\Sigma \Delta E = Q$). Changing the physical location of where $y = 0$ does not affect $\Delta y$.

Numerical answer:  Speed at 4 m above the floor = 7.1 m/s. 

Follow up question: In the example involving temperature and phase changes, the “part in the middle” of the process is a different energy system not accounted for in the initial and final values of temperature

FYI: Although they are not asked to put up any diagrams, here are the initial and final values of the indicators for the two ways of answering this question, i.e., as one overall process, or split into two sub-processes.

Overall process $PE_{grav}$ ($y_i $= 1.5 m; $y_f$ = 4 m), 
$KE$ ($v_i$ = 10 m/s; $v_f$ = ?)

Split process-		$PE_{grav}$ ($y_i$ = 1.5 m; $y_f$ = $y_{max}$)
$KE$ ($v_i$ = 10 m/s; $v_f$ = 0);
 
$PE_{grav}$ ($y_i$ = $y_{max}$; $y_f$ = 4 m)

The \FNT{} asks them to construct two diagrams, one from the release point to some intermediate height on the way up, and the other from the release point the same height on the way down. The point is the two diagrams are identical (except for the identification of the end of the interval). 

Equivalently, they could simply argue that with only two energy systems, if $\Delta y$ = 0, then  $\Delta v$ will

\noindent After throwing her ball in the air a few times, Christine is tired of playing with the ball and instead moves on to water balloons (much more fun, right?). She stands on top of the Science Building, ready to launch her water balloon.

Their main difficulty with this \FNT{} seems to be with the initial and final conditions. For example, it is not necessarily obvious to some of them that ``…moving down through equilibrium…'' means at the equilibrium position.

 \begin{itemize}
 	\item[\textbf{Read:}] You should already have used the principle of energy conservation to develop an equation for the change in height of a ball thrown straight up in the air (from \hyperref[act2.2.1b]{Activity~\ref{act2.2.1b}}).
	
	\item[\textbf{Do:}] Write a sentence or two explaining what fundamental feature of the \EnergyInteractionModel{} ``accounts for'' why changing the location of $y = 0$ does not change your calculation of the ball's maximum height above the floor. [\textbf{Hint:} think about the general form of the algebraic expression of energy conservation.]

	\item[\textbf{Read:}] When you model the process described in \ref{fnt2.2.1-2} in two different ways, i.e., using an interval corresponding to the overall process in versus splitting the overall process into two contiguous pieces with separate intervals corresponding to each part, you should get the same result for the speed of the ball at \unit[4]{m} above the floor.
	
	Check with your instructor for the correct numerical answer.
	
	\item[\textbf{Do:}] In terms of the \EnergyInteractionModel{}, why is it not necessary to divide the overall process into two pieces in order to find the speed of the ball at \unit[4]{m} above the floor falling down?
