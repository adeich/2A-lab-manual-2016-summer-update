If the initial upward speed of the ball in \hyperref[act2.2.1b]{Activity~\ref*{act2.2.1b}} is \unitfrac[10]{m}{s}, and the ball is released at a height of \unit[1.5]{m} above the floor, what is {\em the maximum height above the floor} that the ball reaches? How far \emph{above Christine's hand} is the ball when it reaches its maximum height, and how is this value related to your answer to \hyperref[act2.2.1b4]{\ref*{act2.2.1b4}} in \hyperref[act2.2.1b]{Activity~\ref*{act2.2.1b}}?
