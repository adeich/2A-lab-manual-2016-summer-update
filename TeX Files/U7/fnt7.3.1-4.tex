NOTE: Use the figure of the disk for \FNTs{} 7.3.1-2, 7.3.1-3, 7.3.1-4

7.3.1-4) Now we pin the disk in place at the pivot point so that the disk can rotate freely about the pin.  Suppose there are only 3 forces, \vec{F}_3, \vec{F}_5, and whatever force the pin exerts, on the disc (i.e. no force of gravity in this problem).  Could both the torques and the forces be balanced in this problem?  Explain.  Include in your explanation drawings of the appropriate force diagram and extended force diagram
