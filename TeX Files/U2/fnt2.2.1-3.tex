Use the \EnergyInteractionModel{} to show that an object thrown vertically upward will have the same speed as it comes down through any point that it had going up through that same point.

One way to do this is to construct two \EnergyDiagrams{}: One diagram should be from the point of release of the ball to some {\em intermediate} height as the ball is traveling upward, less than the {\em maximum} height; the second diagram should be from the point of release of the ball to that same intermediate height as the ball is on its way down. Then, compare the two diagrams.
