\label{fnt7.2.1-6}

When a rubber ball dropped from rest bounces off the floor, its direction of motion is reversed because
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item energy of the ball is conserved;
	\item momentum of the ball is conserved;
	\item the floor exerts a force on the ball that stops its fall and then drives it upward;
	\item the floor is in the way and the ball has to keep moving;
	\item none of the above.
\end{enumerate}
