\note{Work and Force:  Our Approach}{
Note that we have basically turned on its head the traditional high school (and most university) physics textbooks’ definition of energy and work, which is: “energy is the ability to do work.”  Rather, we say, work is one way that energy is transferred between physical systems, just like heat is one way energy is transferred between macroscopic physical systems. Also, we ease slowly into the concept of force.  Later, we get to Newton’s 2nd law and the connection between force and the change of motion.  BUT, force is also involved in work, which is a transfer of energy, and work is related to force: “work done is equal to the product of the force moved through a parallel distance”.  Thus, we can make predictions and answer questions about particular forces using the Energy-Interaction Model, if the force in question is involved in a work term.

\section[Particular Models involving Mechanical Energy]{Creating Particular Models with Mechanical Energy Systems}
\label{act2.1.3}

\begin{overview}

\noindent\textbf{Overview:} The problems in this section illustrate how we can use the \EnergyInteractionModel{} to answer questions and make predictions about the allowed behavior of interacting objects that are difficult to approach in any other way.
	
\end{overview}


\subsection{Three Thrown Rocks}
\note{Purpose}{
To get students used to the idea of using the energy-interaction model with mechanical energies AND using energy-system diagrams to keep from making mistakes.  The point is that actually going through the process of making the energy-system diagram helps you to “think the right thoughts” to be able to easily answer the kinds of questions asked here.

\label{act2.1.3a}

\note{For \FNT~\thechapter-\ref{fnt2.1.1-1}}{Purpose: to learn to try out the logic of the model when confronting new phenomena, especially when there are strongly held intuitive ideas that can lead you astray.
\\[0.25in]
Encourage the groups to get their responses up on the board quickly.  Remind them that they had plenty of time to complete the \FNT{} at home.  Class time should be devoted to part \ref{fnt211-1g} not the earlier parts.

\ref{fnt211-1e} and \ref{fnt211-1e} NO DIFFERENCES

\label{fnt211-1f}  
    i)  all have same final speed\\
    ii)  might have to include dissipation (air friction) if distances are large or mass density of objects is small.\\
    iii)  Can be absolutely sure that with only the two energy systems, KE and PEgravity, this model predicts they all have same final speed.  Cannot be sure the particular model created (with only two energy systems) matches the real phenomenon sufficiently well.  There might be other significant energy changes that need to be included in the model.  E.g., instead of rocks, you threw nerf balls. 
\\[0.25in]
The obvious one that contradicts the construction of the particular two-energy system particular model is that since the distances traveled by the three balls is different, there could be differences in the amount of energy transferred to thermal systems.  This could make the speed of the ball thrown straight down greater just before it hits than the other two.   The intuitive ideas that actually contradict the basic ideas of the Energy-Interaction Model have to do with not really understanding/accepting that KE does NOT depend on velocity, but rather on simply speed and that speed is what is asked about in the question.  The other basic idea that students have trouble with is that the change in energy really really truly does not depend on what happens during the process, but ONLY on the values at the beginning and end.  This is really the HEART of any conservation model, which includes the Thermo model we get to at the end of the quarter.   Of course, you can step through the process of throwing it straight up and then put it all together.  Since the ending values of one step are the beginning values of the next step, when you add up all three processes, the intermediate values all cancel out and you are left with just the beginning and ending values.  Some students might have to go through this step for themselves to fully convince themselves.

\noindent Using the prompts below, \textbf{briefly} compare your group members' responses to \ref{fnt2.1.1-1} and put a short answer on your board (each letter corresponds to the same letter in the \FNT):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\eqref{fnt211-1b}]	Does the \textbf{\em question} involve a parameter that you know to be an indicator of the change in an energy system?  Which energy system and what is the indicator?
	
	\item[\eqref{fnt211-1c}]	Draw an \EnergyDiagram{} for Rock X with an algebraic representation consisting of the following two lines.
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item $1^{st}$ line, using $\Delta E$'s with subscripts.
		\item $2^{nd}$ line, substitute in algebraic expressions for each $\Delta E$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Do \textbf{NOT} solve for anything!
	
	\item[\eqref{fnt211-1d} \& \eqref{fnt211-1e}] Are there ANY differences in the \EnergyDiagrams{} for Rocks X, Y, and Z?
	
	\item[\eqref{fnt211-1f}] \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
		\item In terms of the {\em particular} model you have created for these phenomena (determined by which energy systems you included), what does your model predict with 100\% certainty about the final speed of each rock just before it hits the ground?
		\label{fnt211-1fi}
		
		\item In light of the dropping golf ball and coffee filter activity (\hyperref[act2.1.1]{Activity~\ref*{act2.1.1}}), what aspect of your model might have to be changed that could change your prediction regarding the final speeds of the ball?
		
		\item So, taking into account what you just determined in the previous two steps, what \emph{is} different about the final states of the balls?
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item[\eqref{fnt211-1g}]	Discuss any intuitive ideas that different members of your group might've had that ``bug you the most,'' because they seem to contradict the \EnergyInteractionModel{}'s prediction that all rocks have the same final speed.
\end{enumerate}

\note{For \WC}{This should be considered mostly on part \ref{fnt211-1g}.  Important points 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The MODEL predicts all final speeds are the same.  There can’t be any argument with this, if it is modeled with two and only two energy systems.  This result from this particular model is what you can be 100\% sure about and you should be eager to bet someone \$100 that you are correct!  If your intuition still contradicts this model result after you have put in serious thought, you probably need to see what you are still missing in your understanding of the model that keeps you from changing your intuition.

\item You can’t be sure you have not left out energy systems that need to be included, because they have significant changes.  It depends on details.

\item This \FNT{} really illustrates the power of simply carrying out the steps of the energy interaction model.  It is very easy to not get this right if you think about things that are not included in the model (like direction).  The energy-interaction model keeps you focused on what is relevant, initial and final states and changes in energy.  Once you realize the initial and final states are all identical, the answer is obvious (all three final kinetic energies are identical)
\end{enumerate}

	\textbf{Check-In:} \emph{Does this all make sense to you?} In the context of this \FNT{}, we discussed some very fundamental issues about energy conservation. If you're not sure about any of the above, please follow up with other students and/or your instructor during office hours. But before you do, carefully work through the entire \FNT{} again!

\subsection{Pulling up a Bucket}
\label{act2.1.3b}

\note{For \FNT~\thechapter-\ref{fnt2.1.1-2}}{
This is the first INTRODUCTION to Work as $F\Delta x$ or $F\Delta y$   Often we will write this as $ F \parallel \Delta x$.  You should probably mention the definition includes $F$ and $\Delta x$ being parallel in a low-key way. We won’t be doing any components until Phys 2B.  The only way it might come up in 2A is that if the force and motion are strictly perpendicular, then no work is done, but this will be brought up when and if it comes up.  

\subsubsection*{First Point}

Students are not told to put up an energy-system diagram intentionally.  Look at how a) is worded.  When you call on someone to provide the explanation for why $W = mg \Delta y$  OR  $W = mg h$  using the model, it should be obvious that it is easier to talk through the explanation if you have a good energy-system diagram present than when you don’t.  The explanation should include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item There is only one energy system that is changing, because the initial and final values of the speed are the same, ensuring there is no change in KE
\item This is an open system, because there is work done
\item The work done must equal the change in the $PE_{gravity}$ . $PE_{gravity}= mg \Delta y$ , or since the change in position is stated in the description of the phenomenon to be a height, $h$, it is appropriate to use the symbol ``$h$''.  
\end{itemize}
It is easier “to do” this explanation if the energy-system diagram is present. 
\\[0.25in]
Be sure to stress this point. Energy system diagrams are used because THEY ARE USEFUL, to keep our thinking straight as in the prior \FNT{}, and here, to make it easier to give thoughtful explanations; they greatly improve the communication process, even if they are not needed to ``do the correct thinking.''

\subsubsection*{Second Point}

This is likely the first time we asked a question about a parameter that does not show up in a complete energy system diagram as did heat, $Q$, and the various indicators we have used so far.  But we know something more about the parameter work.  We know that it is $F \parallel \Delta y$ or $F \parallel h$ .  It is useful to remember that there is this relationship between work and force when work comes up in a phenomenon to which the Energy-Interaction Model can be applied.  Point this out to your students.  It will come up again in the future.

\subsection{Including the Potential Energy of a Spring}
\label{act2.1.3c}

\note{Timing: \unit[20]{min}}{
This activity was re-written to make it less of a “plug and chug” kind of problem.  It now stresses model-based-reasoning.  That is, develop the model—in this case, the Energy-Interaction Model—AND then use the model to reason through the questions of interest. In this case, what property of the various cars determines the speed of the car.  Since the model predicts that the KE of any car will be the same (simply the change in the spring PE), it is the mass of the car that determines its speed: larger mass, less speed

}

\begin{benumerate}
	\bitem{The Phenomenon}

	A toy car launcher works as follows:  There is a compressible spring that is attached to a horizontal rail, on which a toy car can roll. The toy car can be pushed back against the spring, compressing it a certain distance. There is a little hook that holds the car against the compressed spring. When the hook is released, the spring pushes the car out of the launcher, down the horizontal track.
	
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{act2.1.3c-toycarlauncher}	
\end{center}
	
	We want to ask some questions and make some predictions about different cars as they come out of the launcher.  Upon close examination of this launcher, it is noted that the spring is always compressed the same amount each time a car is loaded into the launcher. The spring stays put inside the launcher as the car is pushed out.

	\bitem{What we want to know or predict}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Do all cars come out of the launcher with the same speed?  
		\item If they don't all have the same speed when they come out, what parameters cause the difference?
		\item What do we need to do to get our car to have a higher speed than our friend's cars?
	\end{itemize}
	
	\bitem{Create a Particular Model and use it to answer the questions}

	Plan what you need to do in your group and how you will proceed BEFORE you start writing on the board.  Be systematic.  Then put your response on the board.	

	\bitem{Suggestions:}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use the \EnergyInteractionModel{} and the \SOModel{}.
		\item Consider what energy systems are involved.
		\item \textbf{Note:} The car is in contact with the spring while it is compressed and separates from the spring just as the spring reaches its equilibrium length. During the time that the car and spring are together, they behave as a spring-mass system.
		\item To simplify the notation, use ``$d$'' for the distance the spring is compressed instead of ``$\Delta x$''.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\bitem{Be prepared to present a precise, logical, explanation that ``gets at'' the answers to the questions.}
