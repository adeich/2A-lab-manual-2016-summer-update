Repeat what you did in \ref{fnt7.2.1-9}, but this time do two separate \pcharts{}, one for the horizontal and one for the vertical components of the motion. Describe in words how the motion changes in the two directions. Compare your two sketches from part~(e) in \ref{fnt7.2.1-9} and \ref{fnt7.2.1-10}. Are the paths you constructed the same?
